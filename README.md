# Web3 Token Swap Router Engine

A professional Web3 reference project that demonstrates how decentralized exchange swap routing systems can be modeled using clean and modular Web3 architecture.

This repository focuses on simulating multi-hop token swaps, selecting optimal liquidity paths, estimating slippage, and generating swap analytics in a beginner-friendly and production-style format.
